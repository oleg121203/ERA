This could lead to unexpected behavior or loss of data.\n- Incomplete analysis: The basic analysis type does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the code. Consider using the deep analysis type for a more thorough analysis.\n\n**Suggested improvements**\n\n- Refactor the code to use a proper logging mechanism instead of `console.log` statements.\n- Implement error handling in the `analyzeByType` method to ensure that errors are handled gracefully and do not affect the overall analysis process.\n- Consider using the deep analysis type for a more comprehensive analysis of the code.\n\n**Specific recommendations**\n\n- Use a library like `winston` or `pino` for logging purposes.\n- Add try-catch blocks to the `analyzeByType` method to handle potential errors.\n- Consider using a code linter to identify and fix potential code smells and other code quality issues.",
